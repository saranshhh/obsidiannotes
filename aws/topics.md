AWS Basics
1. types
2. services
3. cost etc.

EBS(Elastic Block Store)
1. storage etc.
2. infrastructure(region, content delivery system, evc)

AWS Compute

Networking, storage
-> region; VPC; availability zone: subnet (internet gateway)

platform as a service; infra as a service
how to launch the EC2 machine; instance (IAM role, VPC; default)
public subnet
define range of IP address
EBS system (storage)
support plans


**->serverless: lambda(configure)**
**global infrastructure -> important: edge locations, content delivery, notations**
**storage: s3**
**RDS, route 53 (important service)**
**EC2 steps(practical)**

Based on the syllabus for the AWS Cloud Practitioner course, here are some potential question topics for a midterm descriptive paper, keeping in mind each question would be worth 10 marks:

**Potential Question Topics**

_Cloud Computing Fundamentals_

1. Explain the core concepts of cloud computing, including on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.1 How does this differ from traditional on-premise infrastructure?
2. Describe the three main cloud computing service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). For each, provide an explanation, a real-world example, and a potential use case.

_AWS Global Infrastructure_

1. Discuss the key components of the AWS global infrastructure, including Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations. Explain how they contribute to high availability and low latency.

_Core AWS Services_

1. Choose **two** of the following AWS services: EC2, S3, Lambda, or RDS. For **each** service, explain:
    - What problem it solves
    - Its key features and benefits
    - A scenario where it would be used

_AWS Security_

1. Explain the AWS Shared Responsibility Model. What are the customer's security responsibilities in the cloud? Discuss key AWS security services like IAM and how they contribute to a secure cloud environment.

_AWS Networking_

1. Describe the purpose and components of Amazon VPC. How do subnets, route tables, and security groups enable you to create a secure and isolated network in the AWS cloud?

_AWS Pricing and Support_

1. Outline the fundamental drivers of cost within AWS. Explain the different AWS support plans and when you might choose each one.
