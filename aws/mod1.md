**Definition:**
->According to the NIST, cloud computing is “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”
->Cloud computing essentially means delivering computing services—like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet ("the cloud"). Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you access these resources on demand from a cloud provider.  
Here's a breakdown of key aspects:
- **On-Demand Access:**
    - You can access computing resources whenever you need them, without needing to make long-term commitments.  
- **Scalability:**
    - Cloud computing allows you to easily scale your resources up or down based on your needs. If your business experiences a surge in traffic, you can quickly add more server capacity.  
- **Cost-Effectiveness:**
    - You typically pay only for the resources you use, which can significantly reduce costs compared to maintaining your own infrastructure.

**Here are the essential cloud characteristics you should be aware of:** 
• **On-demand self-service:** This characteristic means that a customer of cloud technologies (even if you are a customer of your own company’s private cloud) can provision and manage resources without the intervention of cloud-hosting administrative personnel. For example, you might deem that you need a new web server to advertise a particular product or service. You can completely provision, configure, and deploy this web server without contacting anyone responsible for hosting the cloud solution. 
**• Broad network access:** This aspect of cloud states that your cloud resources should be available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms. These standard access approaches (such as HTTPS) promote the use of cloud by thin or thick client platforms (for example, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations). 
**• Resource pooling:** The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple clients using a multitenant model. This model allows multiple customers to securely use the same physical hardware of the provider. At any time, the cloud provider can use different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. You should note that this approach provides a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources. If required, the customer is typically able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (such as country, state, or geographical zone). Examples of resources that are typically pooled include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth. 
**• Rapid elasticity:** Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward in accordance with demand from customers. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time. 
**• Measured service:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability. This is done by the provider at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service. For example, the metering might be based on storage, processing, bandwidth, or active user accounts. Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service. This is where the cloud services your IT department pays for are often compared to a utility bill. Like with the electric bill, you can be billed monthly, for just those services you used

####The “as a Service” technologies we see today include the following: 
• Software as a Service (SaaS): This is currently the most popular cloud model. Here the customers access a provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser, or a program’s interface. Note that in this model, the customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings. 
• Platform as a Service (PaaS): This model provides a cloud infrastructure to the customer. This permits the customer to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications developed for the cloud. The provider ensures the required programming languages, libraries, services, and tools are available for the customer. Typically, this is done on a pay-per-use or charge-per-use basis. Note that in this case, a cloud infrastructure is the collection of hardware and software that enables the five essential characteristics of cloud computing. The cloud infrastructure can be viewed as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer. The physical layer consists of the hardware resources necessary to support the cloud services being provided, and typically includes server, storage, and network components. The abstraction layer consists of the software deployed across the physical layer, which manifests the essential cloud characteristics. Conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical layer. Notice also that the customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure, including the network, servers, operating systems, and storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment. 
• Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Allows the customer to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources. The customer is then able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure, but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications. The customer might also have limited control of select networking components such as host firewalls

How are cloud technologies commonly deployed? These deployment models are all in practice today: • Private cloud: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers, which of course might be business units. It might be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of both, and it might exist on or off premises. • Community cloud: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (for example, an overall mission or shared security requirements). It might be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of both. It might exist on or off premises. 
• Public cloud: The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It might be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic institution, or government organization, or some combination of the three. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider. • Hybrid cloud: The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability. This is a widespread deployment model today.

Compute Service AWS offers many different options for your acquisition and execution of computing resources. This section provides an overview of these many services: 
• Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): EC2 is a web service that provides secure and resizable compute resources in the AWS Cloud. The EC2 service allows you to provision and configure capacity with minimal effort. It provides you with easy control of your computing resources. EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new servers (EC2 instances) to minutes. This efficiency allows you to scale capacity vertically (up and down, making your server resources bigger or smaller, respectively) and horizontally (out and in, adding more capacity in the form of more instances) as your computing requirements change. We call this remarkable quality “elasticity,” and we cover that in greater detail in Chapter 2, “Advantages of the AWS Cloud.” Figure 1-1 shows two virtual machines running in AWS EC2. Figure 1-1 EC2 in AWS 
• Lambda: AWS Lambda lets you run code without the burden of provisioning or managing servers. This code you run against Lambda can be for various aspects of an application or service. When you use Lambda, you upload your code, and Lambda does everything required to run and scale your code with high availability and fault tolerance. Again, you are not required to provision or configure any server infrastructure yourself. Figure 1-2 shows the Lambda graphical user interface (GUI) in AWS. Figure 1-2 AWS Lambda 
• Elastic Beanstalk: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with popular languages such as Java, PHP, and Python, to name a few. These web applications are run on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and Internet Information Services (IIS). Amazingly, with this service, you upload your code, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning to load balancing, auto- scaling, and application health monitoring. Figure 1- 3 shows the GUI interface of Elastic Beanstalk.
• Elastic Container Service (ECS): The Amazon Elastic Container Service is a highly scalable, high- performance container management service that supports Docker containers. ECS permits you to run applications on a managed cluster of EC2 instances efficiently. It eliminates the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure.

### Storage Services 
The demands placed on storage for digital information today is higher than ever—and getting bigger all the time. It is no wonder that AWS offers many services in this regard. The list that follows highlights the important ones we will discuss further in this text: 
• Simple Storage Service (S3): The AWS Simple Storage Service is object storage with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is designed to deliver 99.999999999% durability. You can use Amazon S3 for a vast number of purposes, such as primary storage for cloud-native applications or a bulk repository (or “data lake”) for analytics. It is so flexible and so easy to work with, there are far too many potential uses to list! 
• Elastic Block Store (EBS): Elastic Block Store provides persistent block storage volumes for use with EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high availability and durability. EBS volumes offer the consistent and low-latency performance needed to run your workloads. With Amazon EBS, you can scale your usage up or down within minutes—all while paying a low price for only what you provision

### Network Services 
Where would we be without the network? Well, back to the Sneakernet, I suppose. Here are some of the critical networking services we discuss in this text: 
• Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Amazon Virtual Private Cloud lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including a selection of your IP address range, the creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can use both IPv4 and IPv6 in your VPC for secure and easy access to resources and applications. Figure 1-4 shows elements inside the VPC

### Security Services 
It is incredible to think that if you do it correctly, you can be more secure with the cloud than with any approach you could take by yourself in your own data center. Here are the major technologies in the security area you should be aware of: 
• Identity and Access Management (IAM): AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. Figure 1-5 shows IAM in the GUI of AWS. Figure 1-5 IAM in AWS 
• Security groups: AWS security groups are associated with EC2 instances and provide security at the protocol and port access level. Each security group contains a set of rules that filter traffic coming into and out of an EC2 instance. If there is no rule that explicitly permits a particular data packet, it will be dropped. Security groups also can be applied to many other services within your VPC, including ELB, RDS, Redshift, ElastiCache, and others.

Terms:
• Regions: Regions are physical locations in geographically dispersed parts of the globe. For example, there are US West regions and US East regions, just as they are regions in Europe and Asia. Inside of each region are multiple Availability Zones (AZs). These AZs house the data centers that actually contain the physical network resources and the massive amounts of data. 
• Availability Zones (AZs): A collection of separate data centers in a region. The data centers are separated as much as possible for high availability, but they are connected together using very high- speed links. Each AZ in a region uses its own power provider (or multiple power providers) and has its own backup generators;some even have their own power substations.
•  Edge Locations: These locations host cached content from your architecture for fast delivery to clients. The caching technology of AWS is called CloudFront. Edge Locations add even more low- latency reach to your clients (beyond the already amazing reach of regions and AZs). Edge Locations are also entry points into the AWS network, when using CloudFront or S3 Transfer Acceleration for data ingestion.
