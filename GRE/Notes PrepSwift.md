To find the number of integers in an interval, simply use the formula below:

	_Last Number_ − First Number +1

For example, to find the number of integers from 27 to 84, inclusive...

84−27+1=58

Sum of integers from 11 to nn

Whenever the interval starts with 11, it's pretty simple. You just need to use the formula below. For example, to find the sum of the integers from 11 to 8080, inclusive...

n(n+1)2=80×812=3240

Sum of integers from n to m, where n≠1:

For this one, you can follow these steps. For example, what is the sum of all integers from 3030 to 101101:

1. Find the number of intergers in the interval: 101−30+1=72101−30+1=72
2. Calculate the sum of the first and last number: 30+101=13130+101=131.
3. Multiply the numbers from steps 1 and 2 together and divide by 22 (see below):

72×131/2=4716

For example, 8!8! has the obvious factors of 88, 77, 66, 55, 44, 33, 22, and 11, but it has so many more!

- **Step 1**: Simply find the prime numbers greater than 20.
- **Step 2**: But what if we want to find the non-prime non-factors? In this case, you simply need to find the multiples (greater than the number itself) of our previously identified primes:

Is the sum below prime or not prime? How do you know?

30!+29 => Not prime, since we know 30! is a multiple of 29, so is 29, hence 30! + 29 is also a multiple of 29 => Not Prime
=>This trick still works even if you find an odd number of multiples in an interval. For example, there are 99 multiples of 33 from 11 to 2828 and each pair adds up to 3030. To find the sum of all multiples, see below:

9/2×30=135

1. The sum and product will both be multiples of 3, for 3 consecutive integers of anything.

Zero is a weird beast.

- It is neither positive nor negative.
- It is even (because it's divisible by 22).
- It is a multiple of EVERY integer.
- It's a factor only of itself.
- 0^0= undefined
