5. A number is divisible by 6 when it’s divisible by 2 and 3 both. e.g. 714, 509796, 1728 etc.

A number is divisible by 9 when the sum of its digits is divisible by 9 e.g. 1287, 11583, 2304 etc.

A number is divisible by 12 when it is divisible by 3 & 4 both. e.g. 672, 8064 etc.  
11. A number is divisible by 25 when the number formed by the last two Right hand digits is divisible by 25. e.g. 1025, 3475, 55550 etc.  
12. A number is divisible by 125, when the number formed by last three right hand digits is divisible by 125. e.g. 2125, 4250, 6375 etc.

The difference between any two primes greater than 2 is always even.

**The square of a number can never end with 2,3,7,8 or odd number of zeros.**

When a two-digit number is reversed then the **sum** of two numbers is always divisible by 11 & the **difference** of two numbers is always divisible by 9

**Theory of Last Two Digits of Numbers Ending with 1**  
  
  

**• Units' digit of the number = 1  
• Tens' digit of the number = Tens' digit of the base * Units' digit of the exponent**

**If a > b and b > c, then a > c. If a > b then (a + c) > (b + c) and (a - c) > (b - c)**

**If a ≠ 0, b ≠ 0 and a > b, then 1a<1b1a<1b.  
  
5. If a > b, then am > bm for m > 0 and am < bm for m < 0, that is, when we multiply both sides of inequality by a negative quantity, the sign of inequality is reversed.  
  
6. If a > X, b > Y, c > Z then (1) a + b + c + .... > X + Y + Z + .... (2) abc .... > XYZ .... (Provided none is negative)**

**14. If |x| > x, then x is negative.  
  
15. If |x| = a, then x = a or x = -a.  
  
16. If |x| > a, then x > a or x < -a.  
  
17. If |x| < a, then x < a or x > -a.  
  
18. If |x - a| > b, then either x - a > b or x - a < -b  
  
19. If |x - a| < b, then either x - a < b or x - a > -b.  
  
20. If |x| = x, then x is either positive or 0.  
  
21. |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|, |a – b| ≥ ||a| – |b||, |ab| = |a| |b|, |ab|=|ab||ab|=|ab|, b≠0b≠0, |a2|=a2|a2|=a2  
  
22. If (x - a) (x - b) < 0, then x lies between a and b. OR a < x < b.  
  
23. If (x - a) (x - b) > 0, then x lies outside a and b. OR x < a, x > b.  
  
24. If x2>xx2>x, then either x > 1 or x is negative (x < 0)  
  
25. If x2<xx2<x, then x lies between 0 and 1. (0 < x < 1)  
  
26. If x2=xx2=x, then x = 0 or x = 1.  
  
27. If x3>xx3>x, then either x > 1 or x is between -1 and 0(either x > 1 or -1 < x < 0).  
  
28. If x3<xx3<x, then either x lies between 0 and 1 or x is less than -1. (either 0 < x < 1 or x < -1)  
  
29. If x3=xx3=x, then x = 0 or x = 1 or x = -1.  
  
30. If x3=xx3=x, then x = 0 or x = 1 or x = -1.  
  
31. If x > y, it is not necessary that x2>y2x2>y2 or x√>y√x>y etc. So even powers can’t be predicted.  
  
32. If x > y, it is necessarily true that x3>y3x3>y3 or x√3>y√3x3>y3 etc. So odd powers and roots dont change sign.  
  
33. ab > 0 means ab>0ab>0 and vice versa. The two are of the same sign.  
  
34. ab < 0 means ab<0ab<0 and vice versa. The two are of the opposite sign.  
  
35. If x is positive, x+1x≥2x+1x≥2 .  
  
36. If X is positive, then

(1) (a+X)(b+X)>ab(a+X)(b+X)>ab if a < b  
  
(2) (a+X)(b+X)<ab(a+X)(b+X)<ab if a > b  
  
37. If X is negative, then

(2) (a+X)(b+X)<ab(a+X)(b+X)<ab if a < b  


  
38. (a+c+e+....)(b+d+f+....)(a+c+e+....)(b+d+f+....) is less than the greatest and greater than the least of the fractions ab,cd,ef,.....ab,cd,ef,.....**

**The figure formed by joining the mid-points of the sides of a square is also a square. In this case the side will become 12√12 times the side of the original square, perimeter will become 12√12 times the perimeter of the original square and area will become 1212 times the area of the original square.**

**7. The equation of a line parallel to a given line AX+BY+C=0AX+BY+C=0, will be AX+BY+K=0AX+BY+K=0 where K is a constant which can be found by any additional given condition.  
  
8. The equation of a line perpendicular to a given line AX+BY+C=0AX+BY+C=0 will be BX–AY+K=0BX–AY+K=0, where K is a constant which can be found by additional given conditions.**

**The equation of a circle with centre (h, k) and radius r is (x–h)2+(y–k)2=r2(x–h)2+(y–k)2=r2.  
The equation of a circle with centre (0, 0) and radius r is x2+y2=r2x2+y2=r2.**
