there is this wilting flower unrolled across the valley,
standing on the precipice,
its petals catching the last light of day
Each leaf resembles with the weight of love,
while mountain shadows stretch their long dark fingers
across the earth we walk together.
time ticks away,
yet still this flower persists, roots deep
in soil that knows our footprints,
reaching toward a sun that reminds me
of the warmth in your smile.

as stars that haven't yet learned
they're meant to burn out.
Some loves, like this flower,
