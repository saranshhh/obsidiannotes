Answer: Parallel computing ->   process of executing several processors an application or computation simultaneously; architecture where long big tasks are broken down into smaller independent tasks which can be processed together.
Real-world data needs more dynamic simulation and modeling, and for achieving the same, parallel computing is the key.
Complex, large datasets, and their management can be organized and using parallel computingâ€™s approach.
-> Traditonally, computers were built for serial computing; ie given command; broken into smaller instructions & processed one by one.

Advantages:
1. faster application processing
2. task resolution is faster 
3. increasing available computation power of the system
4. saves time & money in the long run
5. provide concurrency
6. solve larger problems
7. reduces complexity
Use case: used by supercomputers; where huge requirements of computation
-> ex: comparison between 1 queue vs 2 queue

Dis:
1. It addresses Parallel architecture that can be difficult to achieve. 
2. In the case of clusters, better cooling technologies are needed in parallel computing. 
3. It requires the managed algorithms, which could be handled in the parallel mechanism. 
4. The multi-core architectures consume high power consumption. 
5. The parallel computing system needs low coupling and high cohesion, which is difficult to create. 
6. The code for a parallelism-based program can be done by the most technically skilled and expert programmer.
7. Although parallel computing helps you out to resolve computationally and the data-exhaustive issue with the help of using multiple processors, sometimes it affects the conjunction of the system and some of our control algorithms and does not provide good outcomes due to the parallel option.
8. Due to synchronization, thread creation, data transfers, and more, the extra cost sometimes can be quite large; even it may be exceeding the gains because of parallelization. 
9. Moreover, for improving performance, the parallel computing system needs different code tweaking for different target architectures
