Parallel computing is computing where the jobs are broken into discrete parts that can be executed concurrently. • Each part is further broken down into a series of instructions. • Instructions from each piece execute simultaneously on different CPUs.
An Instruction Stream is a sequence of instructions that are read from memory. Data Stream is the operations performed on the data in the processor.

Flynn’s taxonomy is a classification scheme for computer architectures proposed by Michael Flynn in 1966. • The taxonomy is based on the number of instruction streams and data streams that can be processed simultaneously by a computer architecture.

• Single Instruction Single Data (SISD): In a SISD architecture, there is a single processor that executes a single instruction stream and operates on a single data stream. This is the simplest type of computer architecture and is used in most traditional computers. 

• Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD): In a SIMD architecture, there is a single processor that executes the same instruction on multiple data streams in parallel. This type of architecture is used in applications such as image and signal processing. 

• Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD): In a MISD architecture, multiple processors execute different instructions on the same data stream. This type of architecture is not commonly used in practice, as it is difficult to find applications that can be decomposed into independent instruction streams.

Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD): In a MIMD architecture, multiple processors execute different instructions on different data streams. • This type of architecture is used in distributed computing, parallel processing, and other high-performance computing applications.


**Features of Flynn’s taxonomy include:** 
• Concurrency: Flynn’s taxonomy provides a way to classify computer architectures based on their concurrency, which refers to the number of tasks that can be executed simultaneously. 
• Performance: Different types of architectures have different performance characteristics, and Flynn’s taxonomy provides a way to compare their performance based on the number of concurrent instructions and data streams. 
• Parallelism: Flynn’s taxonomy highlights the importance of parallelism in computer architecture and provides a framework for designing and analyzing parallel processing systems

**Advantages:**

- **Simplicity and Clarity:**
    - It offers a straightforward and easily understandable framework for classifying parallel computer architectures.
    - This simplicity makes it a valuable tool for introductory education on parallel processing.
- **Fundamental Understanding:**
    - It helps in grasping the basic concepts of parallel processing by distinguishing between different ways of handling instructions and data.
    - It provides a basis for discussing and comparing various parallel architectures.
- **Conceptual Framework:**
	- It provides a basic framework for thinking about parallelism and how different architectures exploit it. This can aid in the design and analysis of parallel algorithms.
- **Historical Significance:**
    - It has been a standard classification system for many years, making it a common language for computer architects and programmers.
    - It is a good starting point for understanding more complex parallel systems.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Oversimplification:**
    - Modern computer architectures are often hybrid, combining elements from multiple categories, which Flynn's taxonomy struggles to represent accurately.
    - It doesn't adequately address the complexities of memory organization (shared vs. distributed memory) or communication patterns.
- **Lack of Granularity:**
    - It provides a broad categorization but lacks the detail to differentiate between variations within each category.
- **Limited Relevance of MISD:**
    - The Multiple Instruction, Single Data (MISD) category has very few practical implementations, making it less relevant in real-world applications.
- **Does Not Account for Modern Architectures:**
    - It doesn't account for emerging architectures like:
        - GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which have highly specialized parallel processing capabilities.
        - Quantum computing.
        - Neuromorphic computing.
- **Ignores Important Factors:**
    - It doesn't consider factors like:
        - Communication overhead.
        - Synchronization mechanisms.
        - Software and programming models.

In essence, while Flynn's taxonomy provides a valuable starting point for understanding parallel processing, it's important to recognize its limitations when dealing with the complexities of modern computer architectures.
